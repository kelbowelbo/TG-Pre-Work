/* In this section, I learned about using color style in CSS.  There are three
types of colors we can use: 1) Named colors — English words that describe colors
2) RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue, and
3) HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness. */
